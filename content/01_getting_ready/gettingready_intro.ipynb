    "The Eriksen experiment is a conflict task. It belongs to the same family of paradigms as the Stroop and Simon task. Participants are instructed to respond as fast as possible to the direction of the central stimulus in an array like this by pressing a response button with the corresponding index finger (in this case the right index finger).\n",

    "Flanking stimuli around the target are irrelevant, but can prime the correct response (congruent), or the opposite response (incongruent). Immediately after stimulus presentation, the attentional spotlight (the area of stimulus information that is selected for further processing) has not yet been narrowed, so the dominant information derives from the flankers, which may point at the wrong response. As the spotlight is narrowed, the support for the correct response increases. In the ERP you are likely to see initial signs of motor preparation for the hand indicated by the flankers (LRP) and signs of error detection processes (ERN). In addition, the ERP will show large components such as the P300. Prior to the P300, there is a weak negative component that is sensitive to the presence of conflict in the decision processes (N200). We will see to what extent these waves can be identified and quantified. Some of these ERP peaks will be analysed in the following.\n"
